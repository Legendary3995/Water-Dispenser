# Automatic Water Dispenser using Arduino UNO
This repository consists of the details for an **Automatic Water Dispenser Project**.

## Working
The working is based on a simple mechanism:
1. The Water Dispenser would have an **Ultrasonic Sensor** installed.
2. As soon as the Ultrasonic sensor would detect hand movement under its range, it would rotate the servo motor, enabling the water to fall.
3. After a *1.5 second delay*, if movement is not detected again, the servo motor would rotate back to its original position; hence stopping the flow of water.

Same would be the working for the soap dispenser, with another Ultrasonic Sensor installed.
Here The soap would be dispensed in intervals, spaces by a second.
